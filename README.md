# Bike Sharing in Des Moines

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use a snapshot of bikeshare data in NYC (specifically August 2019) and run analyses on it/produce visualizations off of it that will help us decide whether a bikeshare business would make sense for Des Moines.

## Results

  ![Checkout Times For Users](/checkout_times_for_users.png)

  The vast majority of rides are less than an hour long, and a majority of those last 20 minutes or fewer.
  
  ![Checkout Times By Gender](/checkout_times_by_gender.png)
  
  The breakdown of trip duration looks similar across genders, though when the gender is unknown, the duration of rides is more evenly distributed across the first ~30 minutes.

  Men were responsible for about two-thirds of all City Bike usage in NYC during August 2019.
   
  ![Trips By Weekday Per Hour](/trips_by_weekday_per_hour.png)
  
  On weekdays, the heaviest windows of usage windows occur during commuting hours (7-9am, 5-6pm). On weekends, usage is highest in the middle of the day (10am-6pm).

  When broken down by gender, similar usage window trends are exhibited.
  
  ![User Breakdown](/customers.png)
  
  A supermajority of New York riders were annual subscribers as opposed to short-term customers.
  
  ![User Trips By Gender (By Weekday)](/user_trips_by_gender_(by_weekday).png)
  
  Male subscribers relied heavily on bikes most days of the week, but Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays were particularly popular.

## Summary
In our sample data set from August 2019, the vast majority of users were males and those users more frequently subscribed to the bike share program rather than paying 

Additional visualizations recommended (temperature, precipitation, Des Moines demographics, urban density, customers vs subscriber by gender)
