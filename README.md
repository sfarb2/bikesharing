# Bikeshare in Des Moines

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use a snapshot of bikeshare data in NYC (specifically August 2019) and run analyses on it/produce visualizations off of it that will help us decide whether a bikeshare business would make sense for Des Moines.

## Results

  ![Checkout Times For Users](/checkout_times_for_users.png)

  The vast majority of rides are less than an hour long, and a majority of those last 20 minutes or fewer.

  The breakdown of trip duration looks similar across genders, though when the gender is unknown, the duration of rides is more evenly distributed across the first ~30 minutes.

  Men were responsible for about two-thirds of all City Bike usage in NYC during August 2019.

  On weekdays, the heaviest windows of usage windows occur during commuting hours (7-9am, 5-6pm). On weekends, usage is highest in the middle of the day (10am-6pm).

  When broken down by gender, similar usage window trends are exhibited.

  A supermajority of New York riders were annual subscribers as opposed to short-term customers.

## Summary
In our sample data set from August 2019, the vast majority of users were males and those users more frequently subscribed to the bikeshare program rather than paying on a short-term or ad hoc basis. In order to get a fuller picture of whether starting a bikeshare business in Des Moines makes sense, there is some additional information we should examine from New York.
- First, it would be important to look at another month's worth of data, particularly during the winter. While we know that August weather should generally be conducive to biking, winter in New York/Des Moines both see bitter cold and snow that would discourage bike riding.
- Also, comparing the urban density of Des Moines to New York could be informative. NYC is obviously extremely dense so many people could use bikes as a mode of transportation to cover a short distance. It merits investigation to see whether Des Moines' density is comparable (albeit on a much smaller scale) to ensure that potential attractions/conveniences are within biking distance of residential areas.
